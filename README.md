# Esperanto

Esperanto is the international auxiliary language created by L. L. Zamenhof in 1887.<br>
It is intended as a second language for everybody to use around the world to break down<br>
language barriers. It is also very easy and straight forward to understand and use,<br>
compared to all the other languages that are spoken and written around the world.<br>
